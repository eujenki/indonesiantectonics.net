If the government can watch everything you do, they can watch every time you spend money. Their ability to control your behaviour is enormous. It will keep you at the mercy of a system in which at the flip of a binary switch you can become a non-person: went to the wrong website, attended the wrong protest, associated with the wrong political party, expressed support for the wrong idea? OFF. You no longer exist. That is scenario A. Scenario B is a world in which we have a fully connected economy using a form of currency that is neutral, transparent, global and open, belonging to everyone, requiring no qualification to enter or access the system, and not under the control of any government or bank. That's what Bitcoin offers.
